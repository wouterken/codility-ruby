Important:
  Look at F moving north west. It aggregates with the line from a moving south west, but before it crosses d and becomes worth 2. We need to keep track of line segments/heights

Conclusions:
a. If I can get left diagonal from a I can score 1
   If I can get right diagonal from a I can score 1

b. If I can get right diagonal from b I can score 1
   If I can get left diagonal from b I can not score anything (c is a blocker)

c. If I can get left diagonal from c I can not score (due to b)
   If I can get right diagonal from c I can score 1, this leaves me right diagonal from a so I can score an additional 1

d. If I can get left diagonal from d I can score 1.
   This leaves me left diagonal from d so I can score an additional 1
   If I can get right diagonal from d I can score 1


e. If I can get left diagonal from e I can score 1.
   This can leave me right diagonal from c so I can score an additional 2'
   This can also leave me right diagonal from b so I can score an additional 1
   If I can get right diagonal from e I can score 1.
   This can leave me right diagonal from d so I can score an additional 1

f. If I can get left diagonal from f I can score 1.
   This can leave me right diagonal from c so I can score an additional 2
   This can also leave me right diagonal from b so I can score an additional 1
   If I get right diagonal from f I can score 1.
   This can leave me left diagonal from a so I can score an additional 1
